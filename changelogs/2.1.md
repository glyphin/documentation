### **:material-format-paint: New Dashboard styling!**  
**2.1 now does the following to the Dashboard**  

1. It applies a tint of the server icon to the background, another detail for the dashboard.  
2. It now shows what page you are on by highlighting it on the sidebar.  
3. The Logout button is tinted with a red hue to indicate a danger button.
4. The yellow color that Glyphin uses no longer is used in yellow elements, instead we now use tailwindcss's yellow color.  
5. Most elements now are slightly more transparent and most things are slightly darker than it used to be.

### **:material-console: Feature Changes**
**New features being applied to Glyphin 2.1 are the following**  

1. 2.1 now allows you to set your own prefix for Glyphin, if for example, the current prefix overlaps a prefix another bot has.  
2. 2.0 used to show a new help embed, we've reverted this for the slash command version, as it isn't necessary for it, and it only shows slash commands instead of message commands only.  
3. We've also now improved the moderation section of our dashboard, it has merged with Auto-Mod (Soon!) and the logs section is dramatically improved, with filtering and search support. It looks nicer in general too.  
4. Glyphin's ping command now outputs in seconds instead of milliseconds.
