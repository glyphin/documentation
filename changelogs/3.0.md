### **:material-console: Feature Changes**
**New features being applied to Glyphin 3.0 are the following**

1. 3.0 is a full rewrite of Glyphin, introducing new commands.
2. Improved user experience in several commands, for example, `setwelcome`, `setleave`, `setticket`, etc.
3. Introduced a fully functional economy system.
4. Implemented every page in the dashboard.
5. Improved dashboard's looks, and made it less distracting.
6. Added self-role, basically reaction roles, but it uses buttons or dropdowns instead. And finally, the most important change...
7. The `ginger` command now has more ginger pictures.

### **:material-format-paint: The Dashboard**
**3.0 also changes up the dashboard quite a bit**

1. The dashboard now has an entire new coat of paint, and is much faster.
2. All pages are now implemented (no more "coming soon"s!)

That's it, quite a lot of changes, we hope you like 3.0!
Stay tuned & updated!
